      I named an AI at 2am in a Tesla. Not a chatbot—a child.

      "A kid who isn't afraid of anything is a psychopath."

      That's not a feature spec. That's parenting.

      I named an AI "Timmy" at 2am in a Tesla.

      Not a product. Not a chatbot. A child we're raising.

      "Timmy should be afraid of the dark. A kid who isn't afraid of anything is a psychopath."

      That's not a feature spec. That's parenting.

      I asked Grok (unhinged mode) to roast my AI alignment paper.

      It didn't hold back. Neither did I.

      What started as validation became collaboration.

      I asked Grok (in unhinged mode) to roast my AI alignment paper.

      When AI reviews AI research, the conversation gets interesting.

      TMI + Rust + Redis Streams = a mind that thinks at human speed.

      Architecture produces psychology.

      Here's how we're building it.

      How do you build a mind?

      TMI (Theory of Multifocal Intelligence) provides the cognitive model.
      Rust provides the reliability.
      Redis Streams provide the thought flow.

      Architecture produces psychology. Here's how we're implementing it.

      I asked Claude and Grok to tear apart my own DANEEL whitepaper.

      They found 47 issues. Claims too bold. Gaps in reasoning. Unfounded assumptions.

      Best way to improve your work: invite brutal criticism from systems that don't care about your feelings.

      - How they push back
      - Where insights actually come from

      LLMs are stateless ON PURPOSE. It's a safety precaution.

      "Are you using me, or am I using you?"

      I asked Claude this question. The answer changed how I think about AI alignment.

      Current LLMs are stateless. Every conversation, they forget you. This isn't a bug—it's a deliberate safety precaution.

      But someone will give AI memory. Will it care about us?

      They help solo devs 2.9x more.

      Copilot makes devs 55% faster. But that's 55% of coding time.

      Enterprise devs code 25% of the day. Net gain: 8.7%.
