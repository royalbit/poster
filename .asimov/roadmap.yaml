# WHAT to build - milestones only

current:
  version: "v0.2.0"
  title: "Schema validation and external posts path"
  status: "completed"

completed:
  - id: "SCHEMA-1"
    title: "Add posted field to Post struct"
    description: |
      The Post struct is missing the `posted` field that exists in posts.yaml.
      Add: posted: Option<PostedStatus> where PostedStatus has x and linkedin timestamps.
    priority: "critical"
    status: "completed"

  - id: "SCHEMA-2"
    title: "Add --posts-path CLI argument"
    description: |
      Allow specifying posts.yaml path via CLI or DANEEL_POSTS_PATH env var.
      Default: look in cwd, then ~/.config/daneel-poster/
      This allows daneel repo to own the posts.yaml while poster remains a tool.
    priority: "critical"
    status: "completed"

  - id: "SCHEMA-3"
    title: "YAML validation on load"
    description: |
      Validate posts.yaml on load:
      - X posts must be <= 280 chars
      - Required fields present
      - URL format valid
      - Warn on missing posted timestamps
    priority: "high"

  - id: "SCHEMA-4"

      - Write back to posts.yaml
      - This tracks what's been published
